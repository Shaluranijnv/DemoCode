            <h1>What is the main cause of PCOS?</h1>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="./images/What is the main cause of PCOS.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Do you know that Researchers, doctors, and health care providers
              worldwide don't know the precise cause of PCOS? Most believe that
              several factors such as insulin resistance, hormonal changes,
              genetics, inflammation, lifestyle changes, and environmental
              factors cause PCOS.
            </p>
            <h3>How does Insulin Resistance Cause PCOS?</h3>
            <p>
              Insulin resistance is caused majorly by lifestyle factors. As more
              blood sugar enters the bloodstream, the pancreas secretes more
              insulin to push the blood sugar into the cells. Over time, your
              cells stop responding to all that insulin. This condition is
              insulin resistance. A higher level of insulin increases the
              production of androgens (a group of hormones that play a role in
              male traits), causing difficulty with ovulation. Many women with
              PCOS have insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to weight
              gain, irregular periods, and even type 2 diabetes if left
              unchecked.
            </p>
            <h3>How do Hormonal Changes Cause PCOS?</h3>
            <p>
              Due to hormonal imbalance, there will be an increase in male
              hormone production (hyperandrogenism). Androgens are called the
              “male hormones”, which control the development of male traits in
              your body. The ovaries produce high levels of androgens (such as
              testosterone).
            </p>

            <p>
              Higher than the normal androgen levels in your body can affect
              your ovaries and prevent ovulation and thus, remain a leading
              cause of infertility. The hormonal imbalance also contributes to
              symptoms, such as irregular periods, male pattern baldness, excess
              hair growth, and acne.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from Androgens, imbalance in hormones such as estrogen,
              cortisol, thyroid hormone can also cause PCOS.
            </p>

            <h3>Is PCOS Genetic?</h3>
            <p>
              Scientists believe that there is a link between certain genes and
              PCOS and that the link is likely to be complex and involves
              multiple genes. A wide variety of genes and mechanisms seem to
              cause PCOS and, so it has a wide range of symptoms and develops at
              different ages for women.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genes trigger a hormone cascade in your body which affects hormone
              levels and insulin resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
              PCOS seems to have a connection with family history and genetics.
              Hence, it runs in families due to mutation in one or more genes.
              It increases the risk for the family to develop the same metabolic
              abnormality.
            </p>

            <h4>How does Inflammation Cause PCOS?</h4>
            <p>
              Inflammation occurs when your body’s natural immune system reacts
              to a foreign substance in an attempt to protect your body from an
              invader. Unfortunately, sometimes this response is triggered to
              react to your cells. Without going all science-y, there is a high
              correlation between PCOS and inflammation markers such as
              oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, white blood cells
              (lymphocytes and monocytes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflammation makes it harder to lose weight and is associated with
              diabetes, insulin resistance and heart disease (common in those
              with PCOS).
            </p>

            <h4>How does Lifestyle Cause PCOS?</h4>
            <p>
              Leading an unhealthy lifestyle increases the risk of PCOS. Poor
              eating habits, lack of physical activity, gaining too much weight,
              sleeping disorders, and high-stress levels are the substantial
              causes of PCOS. It also leads to physically and emotionally
              distressing symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              A diet high in carbohydrates can cause insulin resistance in your
              body. It can cause low-grade inflammation, which stimulates the
              androgens' production and cysts' creation in your ovaries. It can
              also lead to cardiovascular problems. Check out Ripsey app and get
              your personalized nutrition plan today. To manage a healthy
              lifestyle, it recommends a healthy eating regime without any
              artificial supplementation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lack of physical activity is a potential contributing factor to
              insulin resistance. It leads to a higher concentration of estrogen
              in the body which causes weight gain. Higher than a healthy weight
              worsens insulin resistance and, it increases the production of
              male hormones responsible for PCOS symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Depression and other mental health disorders can worsen your PCOS
              symptoms. It causes reproductive dysfunctions in your body (e.g.,
              infertility).
            </p>
            <p>
              Lack of quality sleep is associated with an increased risk of
              obesity, fatigue, increased hunger, and insulin resistance.
            </p>
